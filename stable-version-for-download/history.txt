v2.0.0-beta6 (03-Mar-2017)
 - larger refactoring of all scripts to work with Bitwig 2 beta 6 (haven't bought the Upgrade yet)
 - BCR2000 + BCF2000 now have a second PAN mode where the Macros used to be,
   so two pans of each channel can be controller simultaneously using the upper+lower knobs/faders
 - TODO more testing, update documentation, update deprecation-detection-scripts

v1.0.14 (13-Aug-2016)
 - no changes in controller scripts (only using more lightweight JS library (knockout-stripped v2))

v1.0.13 (04-Aug-2016)
 - BCR2000: the lower 3 encoder rows in PARAM mode now allow controlling 3*8 parameters simultaneously (incl. non-fixed parameter pages)
 - BCR2000 + BCF2000: PARAM mode now recalls the last selected parameter page per device
 - BCR2000 + BCF2000: Morpher for PARAM mode will now morph parameters of ALL pages (i.e. up to 12*8 parameters) simultaneously
 - BCF2000 + BCF2000: Morpher for PARAM and MACRO mode will recall snapshots per device

v1.0.12 (06-May-2016)
 - fixed BCR2000 auto-switch to preset 29 via sysex
 - BCF2000 script sending sysex instead of ProgramChange to switch device into preset 28

v1.0.11a (05-May-2016)
 - changed BCR2000 SysEx + script (all encoders now sending relative values)

v1.0.11 (02-May-2016)
 - added Behringer BCR2000 script, identical to BCF2000 script but faders represented by the first of the three lower encoder rows

v1.0.10 (24-Jan-2016)
 - DC-1 script: made MIDI channel for program/bank change messages configurable

v1.0.9 (23-Jan-2016)
 - added Behringer CMD DC-1 script for generating ProgramChange messages

v1.0.8 (08-Jan-2016)

   (Updating the BCF is not necessary if the script was working already)
