v2.0.0 (24-Mar-2017)
 - finished refactorings for final Bitwig 2.0 (demo version)
 - Params mode on BCR/BCF2000 now only controls the currently selected remote controls page + follows page-selection from the DAW

v2.0.0-beta6 (03-Mar-2017)
 - larger refactoring of all scripts to work with Bitwig 2 beta 6 (haven't bought the Upgrade yet)
 - BCR2000 + BCF2000 now have a second SENDS mode where the Macros used to be,
 Â  so two sends of each channel (even 4 on the BCR) can be controlled simultaneously using the upper+lower knobs/faders

 - BCR2000: the lower 3 encoder rows in PARAM mode now allow controlling 3*8 parameters simultaneously (incl. non-fixed parameter pages)
 - BCR2000 + BCF2000: PARAM mode now recalls the last selected parameter page per device
 - BCR2000 + BCF2000: Morpher for PARAM mode will now morph parameters of ALL pages (i.e. up to 12*8 parameters) simultaneously
 - BCF2000 + BCF2000: Morpher for PARAM and MACRO mode will recall snapshots per device

v1.0.12 (06-May-2016)
 - fixed BCR2000 auto-switch to preset 29 via sysex
 - BCF2000 script sending sysex instead of ProgramChange to switch device into preset 28

v1.0.11 (02-May-2016)
 - added Behringer BCR2000 script, identical to BCF2000 script but faders represented by the first of the three lower encoder rows

v1.0.8 (08-Jan-2016)
